<h1>Weather Application</h1>

A webpage that prompts users to enter a zipcode, then displays current weather information for that location or a friendly error message if the zipcode is not found.

<h1>MVP (minimal viable product)</h1>

The app should display a title, input box for zipcode, and submit button.

That's all that should display by default.

When the submit button is clicked, the application should fetch weather data from api.openweathermap.org.

If the request is successful, display:

City name
Current conditions,
Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celius, and
an image, selected by the current temperature.
If the request is not successful, display an error message.

<h1>Enhancements</h1>

Improve error messaging to be more specific.
